This is both to prevent collisions, and also to prevent sneaky breaking changes to your styles if we update the class underneath you and you were relying on our styles.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can target the classes without the hash by using a [partial selector](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/attribute/):\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n[class*='Banner-module--column'] {\r\n  color: $text-04;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will match the class that starts with `Banner-module--column` and would be immune to any changes to the hash. We may at some point remove the hash if this becomes an issue.\r\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"61e9843526e9b110f7b58353d7a7e5fd","counter":144,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Styling","description":"Guide for adding site-specific styles and targeting theme components"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: Styling\r\ndescription: Guide for adding site-specific styles and targeting theme components\r\n---\r\n\r\n<PageDescription>\r\n\r\nThe carbon theme uses Sass to take advantage of the carbon-components styles and variables while authoring novel components.
